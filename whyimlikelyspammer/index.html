Hey! you got this sent to you to explain why the fuck I'm "likely spammer" :3

1. I'm not. 
2. discord's auto flagging system is total bullshit, just because I sent a few too many friend requests, I'm now seen as a likely spammer. 3. if you would like to talk to me without the annoying likely spammer shit please do add my telegram (@zaynedrift), I get mobile notifications there too so I know when you've sent a message. OR you could download https://vencord.dev to your client and turn on the "iLoveSpam" Plugin, there should be some tutorials on youtube or something :3
